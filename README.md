# Timber
VERY quick and dirty bot for tinder

So yes I got lazy(again) and automated the right swipe for Tinder(Web). This script uses Selenium and Python 3(any version above 3.3 works fine)

So once I run the script I've got 60 seconds to log in to Tinder and skip the intial tutorial. After that, sit back and relax as the script right swipes EVERY (yes, it doesn't differentiate between male and female yet, but tinder got that sorted for me didn't it?) profile at a rate of 1 profile a second.

So yeah, I broke tinder in my desperation

Damn...
